Slide 1:
Hello everyone, welcome to today's lecture on Scheduling, which is the seventh topic in our Operating System series, Three Easy Pieces. I'm excited to dive into this fundamental concept with you, and I'm sure by the end of this lecture, you'll have a solid understanding of how operating systems manage tasks.

To get started, let's take a step back and ask ourselves, what exactly makes up an operating system. This is a crucial question, as it sets the foundation for our discussion on scheduling. So, let's move on to the next slide, where we'll break down the components of an operating system, including the kernel and its role in managing user processes.

Slide 2:
Let's dive into the components that make up an operating system. Understanding what constitutes an operating system is crucial for our discussion on scheduling. On this slide, we have What constitutes an OS Kernel + other components.

Let's break it down. The kernel is a privileged process that runs in kernel mode, as controlled by the hardware. It's loaded by a bootloader, such as GRUB or a custom one, at boot time, and it will run until the device is turned off. The kernel enables a user process to run on the CPU in a limited direct execution fashion via a context switch. This means that the kernel acts as a mediator between user processes and the hardware, allowing multiple processes to share the CPU.

The kernel also performs privileged operations on behalf of user processes through system calls, which are invoked via a trap instruction. Think of system calls like a request from a user process to the kernel, asking it to perform a specific task that requires privileged access, such as reading or writing to a file.

Now that we have a better understanding of the kernel and its role in managing user processes, let's consider how the operating system decides which process to run on the CPU next.

Slide 3:
Let's take a look at this slide on Developing a Scheduling Policy. As we explore how operating systems manage processes, we need to consider how to select which user process to run on the CPU. This is a crucial decision, as it affects the overall performance and efficiency of the system.

We have four main questions to consider: How do we select which user process to run on the CPU? What are the key assumptions we make about the workload? What metrics are important in evaluating our scheduling policy? And what are some historical approaches to scheduling that we can learn from?

When we think about selecting a user process to run on the CPU, we need to consider factors like priority, resource availability, and the process's current state. We also need to make assumptions about the workload, such as the types of processes that will be running, their resource requirements, and their expected execution times. These assumptions will help us design a scheduling policy that meets the needs of our system.

In terms of metrics, we might consider factors like throughput, response time, and fairness. We want our scheduling policy to maximize throughput, minimize response times, and ensure that each process gets a fair share of CPU time. By evaluating our policy based on these metrics, we can refine and improve it over time.

There have been many different scheduling algorithms developed over the years, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. By studying these approaches, we can learn from the successes and failures of others and develop more effective scheduling policies for our own systems.

We've covered the basics of what constitutes an OS, and we've explored the key concepts of scheduling and process management. I hope you now have a better understanding of how operating systems work and how they manage processes to ensure efficient and effective use of system resources. Thanks for your attention, and I'll see you in the next lesson.
